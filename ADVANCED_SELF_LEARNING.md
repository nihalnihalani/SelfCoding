# Advanced Self-Learning System

## Overview

CodeForge now implements cutting-edge research-backed self-improvement techniques that go far beyond basic pattern matching. The system incorporates multiple advanced learning paradigms working together to create a truly self-improving AI coding agent.

## ðŸ§  Core Research-Backed Components

### 1. Advanced Reflexion Framework

**Based on**: Latest research in AI self-reflection and meta-cognition

**Features**:
- **Multi-Level Reflection**: Tactical (immediate), Strategic (patterns), Meta (learning about learning)
- **Causal Analysis**: Uses LLM to identify cause-effect relationships in performance
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: "What if we had done X instead?" analysis
- **Confidence-Weighted Insights**: Only high-confidence insights are retained
- **Evidence-Based Learning**: All insights backed by concrete evidence

**Implementation**:
```python
# Multi-level reflection with causal analysis
insights = await self.advanced_reflexion.deep_reflection_cycle(
    task_context={'description': task, 'approach': 'standard'},
    performance_data=performance_data,
    external_feedback=external_feedback
)
```

### 2. Curriculum Learning System

**Based on**: Progressive learning theory and skill acquisition research

**Features**:
- **Difficulty Progression**: BEGINNER â†’ INTERMEDIATE â†’ ADVANCED â†’ EXPERT â†’ RESEARCH
- **Prerequisite Tracking**: Tasks have dependencies that must be mastered first
- **Adaptive Task Selection**: Suggests next tasks based on current skill level
- **Mastery Criteria**: 80% success rate with quality >75 over minimum attempts
- **Focus Area Identification**: Automatically identifies struggling domains

**Task Categories**:
- UI Components (buttons, forms, layouts)
- Data Visualization (charts, dashboards)
- Interactive Apps (games, calculators, tools)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, optimization)
- Full-Stack (APIs, databases, real-time features)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Get curriculum-guided recommendations
recommended_tasks = self.curriculum.get_next_recommended_tasks(3)
self.curriculum.record_task_attempt(task_id, success, quality_score)
```

### 3. Meta-Learning Engine

**Based on**: Learning-to-learn research and strategy optimization

**Features**:
- **Strategy Recommendation**: Chooses optimal learning strategy per task
- **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Applies knowledge from similar domains
- **Adaptive Parameters**: Self-adjusts exploration vs exploitation balance
- **Learning Efficiency Tracking**: Monitors quality improvement per time unit
- **Strategy Performance Analysis**: Tracks which strategies work best when

**Learning Strategies**:
1. **Imitation**: Learn from successful examples and patterns
2. **Exploration**: Try novel approaches and creative solutions
3. **Refinement**: Improve upon previously successful approaches
4. **Transfer**: Apply knowledge from similar domains
5. **Composition**: Combine multiple successful patterns

**Implementation**:
```python
# Get optimal strategy for current task
strategy, params = await self.meta_learner.recommend_learning_strategy(
    task_domain=domain,
    task_complexity=complexity,
    available_examples=examples,
    time_budget=60
)
```
