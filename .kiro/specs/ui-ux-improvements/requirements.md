# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for comprehensive UI/UX improvements to the CodeForge application. CodeForge is a self-improving AI code generation system with a multi-agent architecture. The current interface is functional but has opportunities for enhanced user experience, better visual hierarchy, improved accessibility, responsive design optimization, and more intuitive workflows. These improvements will make the application more professional, easier to use, and more engaging for developers and AI researchers.
