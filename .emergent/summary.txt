<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built CodeForge, a self-improving AI code agent, from scratch. Initial setup faced dependency installation and resource issues, leading to a temporary shift from ChromaDB to in-memory pattern storage. The core functionality, including app generation, pattern library, and dashboard, was established. Subsequently, a multi-agent A2A protocol, CopilotKit UI, self-learning mechanisms (Reflexion, Hierarchical Memory), and Daytona sandbox integration were added. Key challenges involved resolving FastAPI router registration for CopilotKit, handling Gemini API timeouts, and ensuring robust frontend-backend communication. The immediate focus before this summary was to fully integrate and debug CopilotKit's frontend components, specifically a missing UI button and ensuring service hooks.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build CodeForge, a self-improving AI code agent using React, FastAPI, and Google Gemini 2.5, for a hackathon, aiming for several prizes.
**Core Features:**
1.  **Frontend (React/TypeScript):** Modern UI with Tailwind CSS, real-time updates via WebSocket, interactive dashboard, code display, pattern browser, learning metrics, and a new Self-Learning tab.
2.  **Backend (FastAPI/Python):** Multi-agent system (Manager, Generator, Reviewer, Pattern Analyzer), self-learning engine (Reflexion Framework, Hierarchical Memory System), pattern library (ChromaDB/in-memory), real-time research (Tavily), automated testing (Browserbase), and secure deployment (Daytona Sandbox).
3.  **AI Models:** Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (planning, reviewing) and Flash (code generation).
4.  **Integrations:** Weave (observability), Tavily (research), Browserbase (testing), Vercel API (deployment mocking), and CopilotKit (AI Assistant UI).
**Current Implementation Status:**
The application features a functional React frontend with four tabs: Generate, Pattern Library, Dashboard, and Self-Learning. The backend supports multi-agent orchestration, self-learning (reflexion, memory), and Daytona sandbox for safe code execution. CopilotKit AI Assistant is integrated into the UI. The main pending task is to ensure CopilotKit is fully functional and its UI components (e.g., chat button) are correctly displayed and hooked to backend services.

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure the CopilotKit AI Assistant button is visible in the frontend.
- Fully hook all services with CopilotKit to make it completely functional, addressing any remaining UI or backend endpoint communication issues related to CopilotKit.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently working on resolving the CopilotKit integration in the frontend. While the backend endpoints for CopilotKit () have been debugged and registered correctly, and the CopilotKit chat panel is visible and displays welcome messages, the interactive button to toggle the CopilotKit UI is not showing up. The engineer has just completed running tests that confirmed CopilotKit endpoints and most APIs are working, but noted a JSON parsing issue with generation via CopilotKit and that the UI button is missing. The immediate task is to debug the frontend display of the CopilotKit button and ensure all services are properly accessible and functional through the CopilotKit interface.

<optional_next_step>
Debug why the CopilotKit button is not showing in the frontend and ensure its full functionality.
